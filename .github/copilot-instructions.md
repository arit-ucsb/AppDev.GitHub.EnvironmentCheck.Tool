When I ask for information, cite your references and provide links to source material.

Do not suggest code formatting or style changes without consulting our .editorconfig file to
ensure alignment with our established coding standards.

Sometimes you will be asked to modify files. When doing so, follow these guidelines:
- Do not change, remove, or add any snapshot verification files. These will have the extension `.verified.txt` or similar.
- Application Scalability and code-base maintainability are prioritized.
- Include comments to explain complex logic, or non-obvious design decisions.
- Do not comment basic code that is self-explanatory.
